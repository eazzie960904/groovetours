                  Seochon was named so for being located west of Gyeongbokgung
                  Palace. It boasts a cozy mixture of traditional shops and
                  houses, and modern buildings. Many gift shops, cafés, and

                  This stream begins near Gwanghwamun Gate and flows into the

                  up to build an overpass over it. However, it was revived and
                  restored to its original state through a city renewal
                  initiative in 2005. The renewal project created a 20-km scenic
                  walkway along the stream with plenty of seating and resting
                  areas. Many events, such as a lantern festival and flea
                  markets are held at Cheonggye Plaza.
